<h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>While being initially developed for military purpose, Wireless Sensor Networks are now widely used for tracking and monitoring purposes.</p>

            <p><b>Environmental monitoring:</b>  Wireless Sensor Networks can monitor environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, air pollution, etc...</p>

            </ul>
            <p><b> Agriculture monitoring</b></p>

            <p><b>Health care:</b>  Sensors can be implanted inside the human body to monitor their health through observing vital signs, electrocardiograms, glucose level, etc...</p>
            <p><b>Military tracking:</b> Military uses WSNs for battlefield surveillance, through tracking the enemy position for instance.</p>
            <p>There are numerous applications and therefore various type of data treated, each of them having specific security requirements such as consistency, reliability, accuracy.</p>
