<h1>Applications</h1><br>
            <p>While being initially developed for military purposes, Wireless Sensor Networks are now widely used for tracking and monitoring. Military forces still uses WSNs for battlefield surveillance, through tracking the enemy position for instance.
            There are numerous applications and therefore various type of data treated, each of them having specific security requirements such as consistency, reliability, accuracy.
            Amongst all the application of Wireless Sensors Networks, the following examples aim to give a complete overview of their power and capabilies. </p>

            <p><b>Environmental monitoring:</b> Wireless Sensor Networks can monitor environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, air pollution, but they are also extremely useful in landslide detection or natural disaster prevention.</p>

                          <b>Forest Fire detection: </b>The spanish company, SISVIA Vigilancia y Seguimiento Ambiental, commercializing projects for the environmental protection, has developed a forest fires detection system using Wireless Sensor Networks. The system coverage area is about 210 hectares, and installed in the North Spain region, comprising the Communities of Asturias and Galicia. The Wireless Sensor Network integrated in the detection system handles the collection and analyse of various environmental variables such as temperature, carbon dioxide, oxygen, ammonia - potential forest fire indicators - and deliver warnings when detection abnormal measurements.<a href="references.html#applications">[1]</a>

                         <b> Industrial monitoring: </b>WSNs are widely used to monitor temperature in buildings, but also to track factories products and transportations.<a href="references.html#applications">[2]</a>

                          A firm called National Interest have launched the WSN that watch over the mechanical vibration, which significantly consumes the durability of the machine. The continuous monitoring of vibrations and other signals is critical to predicting mechanical behavior and efficiency and usually requires continuous data acquisition and online database analysis

                          <b>Agriculture Monitoring: </b>WSNs re highly useful for watching over the disease in the field. The plant disease can dramatically affect the harvest very quickly. It is important to watch over the condition of the field constantly to prevent the disease from happening, and analyze the cause of it, which is impossible to do manually especially for a large size field. 
                          At Iowa State University, there is a research aiming to develop a monitoring system that watch over a rice field throughout the growing season. The sensor nodes are located inside and outside of the greenhouse to measure the temperature, humidity and the growth level of the plant. In case of the plant disease, one can analyze the fluctuation of these environmental variable to spot the cause, or one can spot the possiiblilty of the disease<a href="references.html#applications">[3]</a>.

            <p>On top of those applications, we can had <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2012/163/g1216310/index.php">Health care Monitoring</a>; in this case sensors can be implanted inside the human body to monitor their health through observing vital signs, electrocardiograms, glucose level, etc...</p>
