<h1> Types of Attackers</h1><br>
<p>In order to secure the network, one has to understand the nature of the attack that the network can possibly suffer. Here we look at the various kind of attack and the classification.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<h3>Active attacker</h3>
<p>One can summarise the purpose of the active attacker as modification; It can modify/destroy/fake the data, or structure of the network as whole and interrupt the communication. Therefore the attack of this nature would affect the integrity and the availability of the data, and causes unfairness in the network which leads to the lower efficiency.</p>

<h3>Passive attacker</h3> 
<p>The passive attacker would not modify anything in the network- their purpose is the information. Information can be the data itself, the cryptographic key, key for authentication, etc. The attack of this nature would affect the secrecy of the data. </p>

<p>Of course the attackers “type” can change. Indeed most of the active attackers are first passive attacker, because in order participate his device in the network, it has to be authenticated. For authentication, you need key. Then how does he get it? The user of the network would not give that to a malicious personnel. Then he has to steal it. In other words, it has to make a passive attack. Once the attacker manages to steal the key for authentication, then he can now authenticate his device and join the network. Then he can develop all the active attack, like Continuous Channel Attack, blackhole attack, Sybil attack etc, taking advantage of being in the security, which may cause even bigger a damage to the network.</p>

<p>It is difficult to argue which kind of attacker has bigger impact on the user of the network, since it highly depends on the situation. For example, if the network is there to collect the data about the forest to keep it sane; like the humidity, the temperature, or the intensity of the sunlight it gets, the user would not worry about the hazard of the passive attacker. It would have a no harm for the user if somebody else knows about how warm it is in the forest. It can be expensive for the user if somebody tamper the information. If the attacker modify the data about the temperature of the forest to 80 degrees, then the user might worry about the possibility of the fire, and they might have to deploy the fire track. That could be troublesome. For other kind of network, like the one that retrieves the data of the nuclear bomb experiment, you might be more worried about the information leak more.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>One can classify the attacker in terms of the location; Insider refers to the attacker that attempts to intervene with the WSN within its range, and Outsider to the one outside of the range. In this context, “being in the range” does not have physical meaning; being in the range of the network means to have an authorised access to the network.</p>

<h3>Insider</h3> 
<p>Implication of the insider attack is that an authorised node(s) is compromised# , or the attacker’s device is authenticated and in the network “pretending” to be a node in the network. This nature makes it difficult to identify the attacker or even to understand that the network is undergoing an attack. Let’s take a network that observes the traffic of a road to detect the overspeeding. The user of the network does not detect any overspeeding for 15 hours. How can you know for sure this “unusual event” attributes to malicious attack? It might be that the radar used to measure the speed is broken, or it might be that people have been driving within the speed limit. It is not trivial to know if the attack is actually going on or not. For more information, see the section of “intrusion detection”.</p>

<p>By having a device that is in the node, that this attacker can reach all the nodes within the range of the compromised/malicious node(s).  Taking advantage of it, insider can develop attack like;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Eavesdropping: </b>
Now that the device of the attacker is part of the network, it has access to the information that is being passed around in the network. (affect the secrecy of the data)</p></li>

<li><p><b>Spoofing: </b>
It can pass fake information, it can modify the information and pass it to the other node. This would affect the integrity of the data.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Collision: </b>
As a authenticated node, it can request data, or send data to the “original” nodes in the network. By doing this repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, it can exhaust the energy of the node, and the network access in the network. This would disrupt the communication amongst the nodes and affect the availability of the data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The massive-version of the insider attack is called Sybil attack. It is basically attack done by a device with multiple identities. More information on the separate page. </p>

<h3>Outsider</h3>
<p>The outsider attack is done with a device that does not belong the the network. Therefore the presence of this attacker is explicit. Therefore to cope with them, we do not have to wonder if it is a malicious attack or malfunction of a node inside. In other words, we do not have to worry about the intrusion detection. That makes a problem a lot easier to manage. Since this kind of attacker does not have an authenticated access to the network, methods of attack are limited to the following;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>DoS attacks</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Jamming</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Resource exhaustion</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attacking devices</h2>
<h3>Laptop-class attack</h3>
<p>In this context, laptop does not mean MacBook or ASUS ZENBOOK, it simply means the device that is more sophisticated and powerful than the node. This means that it has a better CPU performance,  stronger battery, stronger radio-transmitting power. </p>

<h3>Mote-class attack</h3>
<p>Term Mote-class attack indicates the attack done by a device that is equivalent/similar to the common sensor node. This implies that the device cannot take care of attack that requires high processing power, computational power or large amount of energy. Therefore the attacker of this nature tend to be insider, because outsider attack has to overwhelm the network by force. </p>

<p>However in general, if a same kind of attack is done by Mote-class attacker and by Laptop-class attacker, naturally that of the Laptop-class is harder to get through. 
Let us take Continuous Channel Attack. If a Laptop-class device develops this attack, it can make more requests at higher speed, because it has better processor thus computational power. Therefore the node that was attacked would run out of the battery much faster, and the exhaustion of the channel access in the network would happen much quicker.
Let us take another example of Eavesdropping. A mote-class attacker may be able to eavesdrop from the nodes only in its vicinity, but for a laptop-class attacker with more sensitive antenna, it might be possible to eavesdrop the whole network.</p>
