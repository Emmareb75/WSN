           <h1>Data Aggregation Protocols & Architectures</h1><br>
            <p>There exist various network protocols leading to specific structures when performing Data Aggregation:</p>

            <h2>Tree-based protocol</h2><p> This protocol creates and maintains a minimum spanning tree, called aggregation tree. All nodes of the Wireless Sensor Network are therefore organised hierarchically. Source nodes, considered as leaves, send data to the sink node by the intermediate of data aggregator – each node has a parent to forward its data. Here, the sink node is the tree root and global data aggregator of the network, in the sense that it is the only node performing the aggregation of the whole network data. Tree-based protocol is extremely efficient because it allows using shortest path algorithms, implementing different minimum spanning trees, and therefore minimising communication and power costs, whilst improving data flow.</p>

            <h2>Cluster-based protocol</h2><p> The protocols here consists of assigning several sensor nodes together to form clusters, each cluster comprising a unique local data aggregator: the cluster head. The data is sent from the source nodes to the cluster head that performs aggregation and then transmits the resulting data to the sink node - or an eventual base-station - directly, or via multi hopping through other cluster heads. As previously stated, the benefit of executing Data Aggregation increases if relay-nodes perform the aggregation incrementally whilst the data is being sent. However, using this architecture, aggregation is only executed once during the data transmission.</p>

            <h2>Chain-based protocol</h2><p> It relies on node neighbouring and results in a flat architecture of sensor nodes. The farthest node from the sink node initiates chain reaction – similar to a domino effect. At each step, the current node sends its data to its closest neighbour, selected as its successor in the chain. This successor then aggregates its own data with the data received and the chain reaction goes on until it reaches the sink node. The issue when using this structure is that if a single node happens to fail or is attacked, the whole data transmission is compromised.</p>

            <h2>Gossip-based protocol</h2><p> The protocol generates a peer-to-peer architecture and, once again, relies on node neighbouring. Based on Poisson process, each node is awaken randomly and communicate its data to one of more of its neighbours - the number of neighbours depending on the gossip algorithm chosen. Thus, on top of communicating information, every node must also be able to aggregate the data it could potentialy receive from its neighbours and has an estimate of the global data aggregate of the network. Gossip-based protocols present the advantage of generating a rough approximation of aggregated data in a very short time<sup>[1]</sup> </p>
