<h1>Alert and Response</h1></br>

<p>As soon as an attack is detected, the base station is alerted where the
administrator can be notified through a client system. The administrator
determines the response, such as revoking the malicious node. After the alert
was received, each node will try to rebuild the routing table to bypass the
possible malicious node if necessary. Finally, the malicious node is revoked
from the network.</p>
