<h1>Alert and Response</h1></br>

<p>As soon as an <b>attack is detected</b>, the base station is alerted where the
administrator can be notified through a client system. The <b>administrator
determines the response</b>, such as revoking the malicious node. After the alert
was received, each node will try to <b>rebuild the routing table</b> to bypass the
possible malicious node if necessary. Finally, the malicious node is revoked
from the network.</p>
