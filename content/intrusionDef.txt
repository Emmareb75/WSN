<h1>Definition and different classifications</h1><br>
<p>Security such as authentication and cryptography enhance the security of sensor
networks, however this methods cannot deter all possible attacks. Attacks may
still come from inside the network, we say <i>“inside”</i> in the matter that an
attacker already possesses acceses to the network, therefore we see the need
for yet another form of defense.
</p>
<p>
ID short for <i>Intrusion Detection</i>  gather data from the system operations at
runtime and
analysis for verification.
</p>
<ul >
IDS can be classified using as a point of
reference the technique they use. Therefore we can identify them as:
<li><b>Signature based detection</b></li>
<li><b>Specification based detection</b></li>
<li><b>Anomaly detection</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Signature based detection</i>
uses previous data, imagined or copied from already fully developed networks, to prevent a
similar attack, but this type of detection makes the network vulnerable to
unknown attacks. However people know exactly what each designed protocol should
functioni, the <i>specification based detection</i>. As a direct consequence, any sensor node that does not follow the protocol specification has a
very high chance of being malicious. The advantage of the
<i>specification based</i>
detection is a very low rate of false alarm, but this kind of defense cannot
detect attacks that do not violate protocol specification. Which leads us to the
<i>anomaly detection</i> which not only detects incorrect behavior(violates
specifications), but also detects abnormal behaviors(that do not violate
specification). In simpler words this kind of defense takes the <i>"normal"</i>
behaviour of the network and compares it with the actual network behaviour in
search for deviations. In
most cases the <i>"normal"</i> behaviour is determined through automate training. Even if anomaly detections can
detect a wider range of attacks compared to detecting
techniques previosly presented.
They have a an immens drawback, the high rate of false alarms.

<ul>
We can also classify the IDS at the basis location on which we deploy them.
<li>IDS
that are operating on a single node are called <b> stand-alone</b> IDS, this
kind of IDS is only responsible for the security of the host node.</li>
<li>IDS
that operate on a single node but the idividual IDS communicate between
themselves are called <b>cooperative</b> IDS, this
kind of IDS takes part in decisions along side other idividual IDS. For example
Ioannis Krontiris, Thanassis Giannetsos, and Tassos Dimitriou in ref.[8]
presents a voting algorithm which is based on the presumption  that an attacker
is not able to outnumber the legitimate nodes.</li>
<li>IDS
located on gateways nodes or separate monitors are called <b>hierarchial</b> IDS. This kind of IDS analyzes network traffic and
uses the data to secure parts of or the entire network.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<emp>In present, most of the IDS for WSN are network-base
and use a combination of specification-based and anomaly-based
detection.</emp>
