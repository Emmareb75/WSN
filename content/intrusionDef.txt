<h1>Definition and different classifications</h1><br>
<p>Security such as authentication and cryptography enhance the security of sensor
networks, however this methods cannot deter all possible attacks. Attacks may
still come from inside the network, we say “inside” in the matter that an
attacker already possesses acceses to the network, therefore we see the need
for yet another form of defense.

<p>
ID short for Intrusion Detection  gather data from the system operations at
runtime and
analysis for verification.

ID systems can be classified using as a point of
reference the technique they use. Therefore we have: <b>signature based
detection</b>,
<b>specification-based detection</b>, and <b>anomaly detection</b>.Signature based detection
uses previous data, imagined or copied from mature networks, to prevent a
similar attack, but this type of detection makes the network vulnerable to
unknown attacks. However people know exactly what each designed protocol should
function. Any sensor node that does not follow the protocol specification has a
very high chance of being malicious. The advantage of the specification-based
detection is a very low rate of false alarm, but this kind of defense cannot
detect attacks that do not violate protocol specification. Which leads us to the
anomaly detection which not only detects incorrect behavior(violates
specifications), but also detects abnormal behaviors(do not violate
specification). In simpler words this kind of defense takes the normal
behaviour of the network, where the network has no malicious attacks, usually
this is accomplished  through automate training and compares it with the actual
network behaviour searching for deviations. Even if anomaly detections can
detect a wider range of attacks compared to previous presented technologies
they have a drawback and that is the high rate of false alarms.
We can also classify the ID systems on the basis of their locations. ID systems
that are operating on a single node are called host-based ID system(IDS), this
kind of ID is responsible for the security of the host node. ID  systems
located on gateways nodes or separate monitors analyzes network traffic and
uses this data to secure parts or the entire network. This ID system is called
network-based IDS. In present most of the ID systems for WSN are network-base
and use a combination of specification-based and anomaly-based detection.</p>
