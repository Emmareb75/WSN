<h1>Deployment Strategies of IDS</h1><br>

<p>We will present a few different strategies of how to deploy IDS in networks
. In general there are three main deployment strategies.

<p>
A simple approach is to install an IDS on <b>every single node</b> (<b>a node
based IDS</b>), so the IDS is only responsible for the security of the host.
This approach almost completely eliminates the communication overhead. But
because of the fact that we place IDS on every sensor node on the path from
source to destination. We can strongly affirm that each packet is <b>analyzed
multiple times</b> leading to a huge waste of computational resources. Further more
we can intuitively see that this approach is very hard to implement efficiently
on a large scale network.

Another possible strategy would be to place the IDS modules on the<b> base
station</b>
. The <b>base station</b> can analyze all the traffic in the sensor network regardless
of topology or routing changes and each packet is not proccesse multiple times.
Nevertheless, altough a packet is not processed many times, this placement
strategy might overwhelm the base station leading to a large number of packets
not being analyzed.

Our last approach will be to make the IDS monitor(watchdog) reponsible for itâ€™s
neighbour nodes, knowing the fact that a node can also oversee the transmission
of neighboring nodes in the wireless world. We already know that a normal
sensor node is resource-constrained and most of the times easy to be
compromised, so it was proposed by C. Tseng, P. Balasubramanyam, C. Ko, R.
Limprasittiporn, J. Rowe, and K. Levitt in ref.[1] to use special
monitoring nodes for ID
usage. In the search for an efficient deployment strategy for the IDS modules
we try to position the IDS monitors in such a way that all the packets would be
inspected only once, in order to ease the resource constraint of the WSN. We
want to place the IDS modules so that the monitor would be able to cover all
paths in the network. In order to achive this, the WSN may be divided into
<b>clusters</b> with each cluster having a <b>cluster head</b>. This approach implies that
every node member of a certain cluster forwards its data packets to the <b>cluster
head</b>. The drawback of this approach is the high quantity of overhead
communication since the nodes do not select the shortes path, but instead have
to forward their packets thorugh the cluster node.

<ul>
<li><p>Y. Huang and W. LeeRef. in ref.[5] deploy IDS only on this <b>clusters
heads</b> in order
to save precious resources. But this method loses monitoring coverage this
happens because the cluster head has no way of knowing details inside the
network, which makes it particularly difficult to detect and/or respond to
attacks, such as jamming attacks, impersonating attacks.
</li>
<li><p>
F. Anjum, D.
Subhadrabandhu, S. Sarkar, and R. Shetty in ref.[6] tried to place
the detection modules at an <b>optimal place</b>, thus on all the nodes that belong to
the minimum <b>cut-set</b>. Here a <b>cut-set</b> is a set of sensor nodes such that all
paths from all cluster heads to the base station traverse this set of node.
This deployment is optimal if we assume that the intruder is to do harm, cause
failure of the base station by delivering malicious packets.</p>
</li>

All the methods
presented so far distribute the ID system among a few nodes and through
cooperation makes the ID as efficient as central-based system. A. Agah, S.K.
Das, K. Basu, and M. Asadi in ref.[7] makes
use of a <b>central-based IDS</b> that we presented in Fig. 2, but specifies that this system cannot
protect all sensor nodes in the same time due to resource limitations.
Therefore, the ID system only chooses the most important node to protect
continuously based on a <b>game approach</b>, which is formulated as two-player
attack-defense problem.</p>
