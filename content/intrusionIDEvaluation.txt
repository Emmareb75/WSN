<h1>ID System Evaluation</h1><br>

<p>There are two common measurements for evaluating the performance of a ID
system: the false positive rate(FP) and false negative rate(FN).  FP is defined
as the proportion of normal events erroneously classified as abnormal. FN is
defined as the proportion of abnormal events erroneously classified as normal.
It is trivial to say that an ideal ID system should have both FP and FN as low
as possible, but in practice this scenario is not quite possible. In real ID
system a trade-off between the two measurements is usually made, given that the
two measurements influence in opposite ways when we adjust the system. Besides
FP and FP we are also concerned with the overhead communication by Id system.
We already know the WSN is extremely resource-constrained thus we would like to
introduce as little overhead as possible. Although WSN are designed for low
rate communication a broad range of real-time application, such as highway
traffic coordination, medical care and even video transmission, have been
introduced. When an ID system is supposed to perform on such real-time systems
it needs to fulfill the real-time requirement so it will not cause performance
issues to the application.</p>
