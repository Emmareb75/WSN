<h1>ID System Evaluation</h1><br>

<p>There are two common measurements for evaluating the performance of a ID
system: <b>the false positive rate</b>(FP) and <b>false negative rate</b>(FN).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>FP</b> is defined
as the proportion of normal events erroneously classified as abnormal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>FN</b></p> is
defined as the proportion of abnormal events erroneously classified as normal.
</li>
</ul>
It is trivial to say that an ideal ID system should have both <b>FP</b> and
<p><b>FN</b></p> as low
as possible, but in practice this scenario is not quite possible. In real IDS
the implentation of the IDS module must make <i>"trade-offs"</i> between the two measurements is usually made, given that the
two measurements influence themselves in opposite ways when we try to favor one
of them.
<p>
Besides
<p><b>FP</b></p> and <b>FN</b> we are also concerned in measuring the overhead communication
that the IDS generates.
We already know the WSN is extremely resource-constrained thus we would like to
introduce as little overhead as possible.
<p>
Although WSN are designed for low
rate communication a broad range of real-time application, such as highway
traffic coordination, medical care and even video transmission, have been
introduced. When an ID system is supposed to perform on such real-time systems
it needs to fulfill the real-time requirement so it will not cause performance
issues to the application. Therefore having a way to monitor a understand the
<i>"complexity"</i> of the IDS.</p>
