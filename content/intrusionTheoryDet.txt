<h1>Detecting Techniques</h1><br>
<p>We presume that the attacks on the WSN can behave in arbitrary ways which
makes it near to impossible to model attacks based on statistics. Nevertheless
we know the behavior of the attacker will violate the normal behaviour of the
network. A.P. da Silva, M. Martins, B. Rocha, A. Loureiro, L. Ruiz, and H. Wong
in ref. [3] proposes that a successful attack on the WSN will show the following anomalies:

<div class="span4">
<ol>
<li><p><b>Interval rule</b>: If the time interval determined by the transmission of two consecutive messages is bigger or smaller than normal a failure is raised.</li>
<li><p><b>Retransmission rule</b>: A monitor listens to a message, in one of his
neighbors where the next message transmisson must occur, but the message is not
transmitted a failure is raise.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integrity rule</b>: The message payload must remain
constant along itâ€™s path in the network from origin to destination. However if in the other sensor nodes exist data aggregation techniques the rule is expected, because the ID system does not care about what is inside the messages.</p></li>

<li><b>Delay rule</b>: The retransmission of a message must occur before a defined interval of time.</li>
<li><b>Repetition rule</b>: The same message can only be retransmitted until a
certain number of times is reached, by the same neighbours. </li>
<li><b>Radio transmission range</b>: All the messages that a node receives must
come from one of its neighbours (note that a node knows its neighbours in
ref.[1]'s approach to the problem). </li>
<li><b>Jamming rule</b>: The number of collisions of a message must be lower
than a certain number of collisions.</li>
</ol>
