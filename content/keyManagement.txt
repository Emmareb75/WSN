 <h1>Key Management</h1><br>
            <p>Since most of the security schemes proposed for wireless sensor networks heavily rely on cryptography, the problem of effectively distributing and further managing the keys needed to ensure secure communication in the network has become one of paramount importance.</p>
            <p>The term <i>key management</i> thus refers to the generation, distribution, storage and continuous renewal of the keys used by the nodes in the network. It therefore concerns guaranteeing the key relationships across valid nodes throughout the network according to desired features such as energy awareness and scalability  <a href="references.html">[1]</a>.</p>
            <p>Although key management in traditional wireless networks has been a well-studied problem for a long time, the limitations of wireless sensor networks in terms of energy, memory and processing power prevent previous protocols from being used. Moreover, WSNs are expected to become orders of magnitude larger than traditional networks in the relatively near future, require resilience against attacks and have unique communication patterns establishing links between sensor nodes, aggregator nodes, or base stations.</p>
            <p>Schemes involving <i>key bootstrapping, network wide shared keys</i>, or <i>master and link keys</i> may suffer from either <i>single point of failure</i> due to the base station needing to keep a database of the link keys or not being scalable due to every node having to store <i><sup>nÂ·(n - 1)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></i> keys in a network with <i>n</i> nodes. Therefore, they have been deemed as not good enough to deal with this type of constraints <a href="references.html">[2]</a>.</p>
            <h2>Types of Keys</h2>
            <p>Cryptographic systems generally distinguish two types of keys: <i>symmetric keys</i> and <i>asymmetric keys </i><a href="references.html">[3, 4]</a>.</p>
            <p>In an algorithm based on symmetric key cryptography, each of the parties encrypting and decrypting a message has the same key.</p>
            <p>In contrast, asymmetric keys are two mathematically linked distinct keys used in conjunction during communication and each sensor in the network has a pair of keys: the public one and the private one. Therefore, asymmetric cryptography is also known as <i>public key cryptography</i>.</p>
            <p>Due to the heavyweight nature of techniques used in public key cryptography (RSA, ECC), symmetric cryptography is the typical choice in wireless sensor networks.</p>
