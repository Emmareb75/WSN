            <h1>Key Management Schemes</h1>
            </br>
            <p>Recent extensive research in the area of wireless sensor networks has led to numerous key management schemes adapted to their specific constraints being proposed. Most existing networks, referred to as static schemes, are built on the principle of key pre-distribution, being based on the assumption of relatively static networks with average to short lifetime. Dynamic key management schemes, on the other hand, assume long-lived networks that should be able to change over time and scale better, aiming for increased security.</p>
            <h2>Static Key Management Schemes</h2>
            <p>Most of the schemes in this category are based on a random key pre-distribution scheme introduced by Eschenauer and Gligor, where the key distribution is divided into three phases: <i>pairwise key pre-distribution, shared-key discovery </i>and <i>path-key establishment</i>.</p>

            <h3>Random Pairwise Key Pre-distribution Scheme</h3>

            <p>In the key pre-distribution phase for a network with N nodes, a large pool of P keys <i>(2^17 < P < 2^20)</i> is generated, from which each sensor node is assigned a ring of K random distinguished keys from the pool <i>(K << P)</i>.</p>            <p>In the shared-key discovery phase, each node discovers all the neighbour nodes from within its wireless communication range which share at least one of the keys in its identifier key set. The shared key thus becomes the key through which the pair of nodes is going to communicate. Taking into consideration the aforementioned notations, the probability for any two sensors to have a common key is </i><i>1 - ((P − K)!)^2/(P − 2K)!P!</i>. The figure on the right-hand side shows graphically the probability for two nodes to share at least one key when choosing a ring of <i>K</i> keys from a pool of size <i>P</i>.</p>             
            <p>The path-key establishment is based on the fact that, probabilistically and due to the design of the algorithm, after the shared-key discovery phase each node is still going to contain a certain number of unused keys which can be used to establish further sensor paths in the network. Therefore, a <i>path-key </i>is assigned to selected pairs of sensor nodes that do not share any key directly, but are connected indirectly one or more links. One of these links will act as an intermediate node which can setup a pairwise key within the initial pair of sensors.</p>
            <p>The bottom left-hand figure shows the average path length that has to be traversed in the network in order for any pair of nodes with key rings of size <i>K</i>to be able to communicate. The right-hand side figure shows the average number of links in which any key in the initial pool is used.<p>
