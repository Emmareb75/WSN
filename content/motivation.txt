            <h1>Motivation</h1><br>
            <p>There is a good motivation to understand this concept to create a better security protocol design. An intuitive approach to address security in WSN would be per-attack basis; for each kind of attack, you establish a countermeasure to it. An alternative, and potentially much more efficient approach would be to break down the problem per-layer basis. In this way, on designing the security protocols in a particular layer, one can make them cooperate with security protocol in other layer to create a complete and more efficient defence for the nodes and the network(2).</p>
