            <h1>Link Layer</h1><br>
            <p>The physical layer is responsible for the connection between two nodes. The Link layer, which is one “floor” higher is responsible for the connection amongst the nodes on the same LAN. LAN is abbreviation for Local Area Network. It means network that covers devices that are physically close to each other.</p>

			<p>Link layer has to offer the protocols that makes the network efficient. For example it has to make sure that the two nodes do not send message to the same node at the same time.(See <collision>). Also, it is link layers responsibility to arrange the network, so that it is flexible, scalable and strong against the <attack>.</p>

			<p>The security of this layer has to make sure that the attacker would not gain the information that is exchanged with in the local network. Or at least it has to make sure that the thief of the information would not understand what the message that he stole actually means, using encryption. It also needs to assure that the information was actually sent by the node that belongs to the network, not by the attacker. This has much to do with authentication and is discussed in the <i>Key Managment</i> section.</p>
