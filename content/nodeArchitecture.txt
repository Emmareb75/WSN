            <h1>Node Architecture</h1><br>
            <p>Sensor nodes are tiny devices that have to support a variety of operations. Therefore they need to be design with care to optimise both their size and perfomances. A conventional sensor node features:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A Microcontroller:</b> that perfoms tasks, processes data and controls the functionnality of other components of the sensor node.</li>
                    <li><b>A Transceiver:</b> that can operate through different states: transmission, reception, idle mode, sleeping mode.</li>
                    <li><b>A Power Source:</b> that has to provide as much energy as possible at the smallest volume, lightest weight, longest lifetime. </li>
                    <li><b>Memory:</b> that is present under two shapes (internal one (micro-controller, volatile) and external one (flash, not volatile)). </li>
                    <li><b>Several Sensors and Actuators:</b> that monitor the environnement and collect data about it.</li>
               <ul>
               </p>
