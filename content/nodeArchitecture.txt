            <h1>Node Architecture</h1><br>
            <p>Sensor nodes are tiny devices that have to support a variety of operations. Therefore they need to be design with care to optimise both their size and performances. A conventional sensor node comprises the following devices:</p>

                            <h3>Microcontroller</h3>
                                <p>The controller performs tasks, processes the collected data, and importantly: controls the performance and the functionality of all the other components of the sensor node.
                                Due to the wireless nature of the system, the processor comprised by the microcontroller must be adapted to embedded applications and consume very little energy. One of the most commonly used processor in Wireless Sensor Networks is the Atmel ATMega: by balancing power-consumption and processing-speed, it presents all the qualities required by the sensor nodes.

                        <h3>Transceiver</h3>
                            <p>The transceiver is the communication interface between the sensor node and the rest of the network: it is able to receive bit streams as well as converting data into streams. Wireless Sensor Networks often use radio band, and in this case, the transceiver has a reception frequency-range; it is able to get data transmitted through a specific and limited radio band – also called radio spectrum.
                            Every transceiver presents different operational states:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p><b>Transmit state</b> where the transceiver sends data converted into bit streams to the network, in a definite radio band.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><b>Receive state</b> where the gadget expects to receive data and receives it.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><b>Idle state</b> where the transceiver is ready to receive data, but does not do so: it means it is inactive. This state is set up by switching off some hardware functions – in the aim of saving energy. However, when being in this state, the transceiver consumes as much as energy than when being in the receive state, therefore it is better to switch it off entirely (sleep state).
                                    </p>

                                    <p><b>Sleep state</b> where the device is not able to receive something immediately due to significant parts of its hardware being switched off. This state prevents from useless power-consumption.</p>

                Although the BTNode and the MICA2 Mote features the same microcontroller, power supply, and have a similar size, the BTNode offers a big RAM capacity (244 kB), much greater than the MICA2 Mote's one (2 kB).
                The MICA2dot, slightly bigger than a  £1 coin, shares the same memory capacity with the MICA2 Mote.
                <!-- However, its battery life remains limited by a 3 V coin cell, whilst the MICA2 offers 2 x AA batteries. -->
