<h1>Routing layer</h1><br>

<h2>Hello Flood</h2>
<p>This is a kind of DoS attack. In some routing protocols, the nodes have to send “hello” message to announce themselves to their neighbour. Naturally the nodes that receive this message would think that it was sent by the node that the radio signal is reachable from them.
 In Hello flood, the attacker takes advantage of this protocol. She sends fake hello message using his more sophisticated tool (laptop-class device) that has bigger transmission  power, from outside of the actual network. Because of his hello message and sufficiently strong signal, the nodes believe that this device is in the radio range. Now she advertises fake low-cost route from her device to the sink. Attracted by it, many nodes link itself to the attacker’s device. Now the packets would be dropped because the traffic is depending on the route that actually does not exist. It can also emit the signal that is stronger than the base station, and pretend to be the initiator of the route.</p>

<i><h3>Countermeasures</h3></i>
<b>Verification</b>
    <p>One can prevent the network from this attack by proving that the signal is not sent by the legitimate node. In [ref] the author suggests to analyse the physical location and the strength of the signal. One can calculate the expected strength of the signal from the location of the node considering the capacity of the legimate node. If the actual signal is way too strong to be a node in the network, then it means that it belongs to the attacker.</p>



<b>Encryption</b> 
	<p>In ref the author suggests to group up every two nodes in the network. Every two nodes have common secret key, and this key is re-generated everytime the communication is made. This would assure that, without being in the range of at least one node, one would not be able to decrypt or verify the message. 
	However it would be very energy consuming to re-generate the key this often. Considering the limited processing power and the battery capacity of the node, this is not a desirable feature. 
	Also if the attacker spoof the identity, this protocol would be ineffective because the secret key will be shared by the node that is supposed to be in pair with the node of which identity the attacker is spoofing. </p>

<h2>Sybil Attacks</h2> 
	<p>[ref1]One of the feature of the WSN is its non-centralized nature. The nodes interact and cooperate each other without any entity that controls over them. In this kind of environment, it is possible for the malicious node to have multiple identity by spoofing the identities of the legitimate nodes in the network. [ref2]
In the WSN, some protocols are dependant on the assumption that there is one-to-one mapping between the identity and the entity. The attacker’s node with multiple identities collapse these protocols. [ref3]For instance the attacker can affect the routing protocol. Each node has information about its physical location. If a node has multiple set of the physical location, that would confuse the system.
[ref3] When the network detects some misbehavior, it is often the case that there are some false positives. In this case, the judgement of “suspicious malicious node” would be pended for that moment, and it waits for it to repeat other misbehavior to make sure. Then the malicious node can switch his identity every time it makes an attack, so that it would not be “accused”.</p>

<i><h3>Countermeasures</h3></i>
<b>Position Verification</b>
    <p>If the nodes are deployed and the location is fixed, then it can detect the sybil attack by comparing the position that should be at and where the identity tells where it actually is. The identities that are possessed by the node would claim to be different place from where the malicious node is, therefore when these identities are inspected, the network would know the intrusion.</p>



<b>Radio Resource Test</b> 
	<p>To detect the Sybil identity, it can put the nodes on a certain test. There are many kinds of tests, and they are based on following assumptions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>A node has at most one radio device.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>A radio device cannot access more than K different channels.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>A radio device cannot listen to more than one channel simultaneously.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>A radio device cannot simultaneously transmit on more than one different channels.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>A node cannot detect a collision while transmitting.
		</p></li>
	</ul>

	<b>Example of Simultaneous Sender Test (SST)</b> 
	<ol>
		<li>Assign different channel on eaclh identity tested.
		</li>
		<li>These identities starts transmitting simultaneously.
		</li>
		<li>With the assumption C), we assume that a radio device cannot transmit on more than one different channel. If a node is possessing Sybil identity Therefore, if some identity is not transmitting the signal, it may mean that it is spoofed by the malicious node.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<b>Example of Force Collision Test (FCT)</b>
	<p>It might happen that the radio devices are limited to a single channel. It is done choosing two identities A and B.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A is required to transmit a message M to B. If B receives M, it should retransmit it.
		</li>
		<li>During the transmission of M by A, two action will be made randomly:
			<ul>
				<li>Cause a collision on B.
				</li>
				<li> Listen to the medium if A transmits M.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
			<p>If A and B are possessed by different node, and there is no collision caused, B will be able to retransmit M. If the collision is caused, then B will not be able to do. 
	If A and B are sybil identities, and actually possessed by the same malicious node, it can only guess what to do. Which one of the two actions is likely going to happen? If the action and the success/fail of the retransmission of M by B do not correspond, A and B might be Sybil identities</p>
