            <h1>Security Issues</h1><br>
            <p>Wireless Sensor Networks are vulnerable to various attacks like any other conventional network, but its limited resource characteristics and unique application features requires some extra security requirements including the typical network requirements.</p>
            <p>As a typical WSN consists of hundreds or thousands of tiny embedded system devices designed for human-unattended functioning, the security requirements need to be approached in a careful way, taking into consideration only robust enough solutions that could potentially suit the limited capabilities of the sensor nodes.</p>
            <p>Generally, sensor nodes are deployed in a dense area and interact with the surrounding environment very closely. This is an additional problem, as WSNs face the risk of tampering or the physical capture of the node and Nodes are exposed to a hostile adversary environment and can usually be easily be exploited if not well enough secured.</p>
            <p>Even if security may conceptually be regarded as a standalone component of the architecture of the system such as the one providing functionality, in the case of WSNs the separation of tasks is not possible. A secure system must integrate the security component into each node, since components without security are susceptible to attacks. If any sensor node is compromised, it may discard or report wrong or modiÔ¨Åed data. The subverted nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. </p>
            <p>The unreliable wireless medium used as communication medium where wireless sensor networks are needed causes many security problems. The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the nodes, from where he can easily intercept the transmission without causing any interruption in the network communication. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can easily inject malicious messages in the WSN. However, for avoiding collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during the transmission, wireless security networks use medium access control protocols.</p>
