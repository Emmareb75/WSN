            <h1>Wireless sensor networks</h1><br>
            <p>Wireless Sensor Networks, often abbreviated as “WSN”, is an emerging and fast-growing technology.  Recent advances in Computing, Microelectronics and Communication, as well as the proliferation of “smart” energy-management applications, have caused increasing interest in Wireless Sensor Networks research.</p>
            <p>WSN provide an economic and simple alternative to conventional wired networks. Indeed, conventional networks scalability is often compromised by the cost of wiring new sensors to the existent network. Moreover, WSN allow access to impossible-to-wire areas such as catastrophe, hazardous or restricted areas.</p>
            <p>A Wireless Sensor Network basically consists of a large number of spatially distributed sensor nodes, also called “motes”. A typical WSN usually counts from a few hundreds to thousands of nodes. Those sensor nodes monitor environmental changes, process the collected data and communicate it to the other nodes through the flexible network architecture.</p>
